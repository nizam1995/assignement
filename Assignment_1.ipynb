    "1. In the below elements which of them are values or an expression? eg:- values can be integer or string and expressions will be mathematical operators.\n",
    "\n",
    "*= (expression)\n",
    "'hello' = values\n",
    "-87.8= values\n",
    "- (expression)\n",
    "/ (expression)\n",
    "+ (expression)\n",

    "\n",
    "2. What is the difference between string and variable?\n",
    "\n",
    "Variables are symbols that you can use to store data in a program. You can think of them as an empty box that you fill with some data or value. Strings are data, so we can use them to fill up a variable. Declaring strings as variables can make it easier for us to work with strings throughout our Python programs.\n",

    "\n",
    "3. Describe three different data types\n",
    ".\n",
    "A. Integer ( The INTEGER data type stores whole numbers. They can be positive, negative, or zero. )\n",
    "B. List (A list is an ordered data structure with elements separated by a comma and enclosed within square brackets.)\n",
    "C. Dictionary ( Dictionaries are used to store data values in key:value pairs)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. What is an expression made up of? What do all expressions do?\n",
    "\n",
    "Expression is made up of values, containers, and mathematical operators (operands) e.g\n",
    "a = 2 + 3 and expressions are used to evaluate the values or represent the result on the screen.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "5. This assignment statements, like spam = 10. What is the difference between an expression and a statement?\n",
    "\n",
    "An Expression always evaluates to a value. And, A statement does something, like creating a variable or displaying a value, it only does whatever the statement says.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "6. After running the following code, what does the variable bacon contain?\n",
    "\n",
    "bacon = 22\n",
    "bacon + 1\n",

    "\n",

    "7. What should the values of the following two terms be?\n",
    "\n",
    "'spam' + 'spamspam' ='spamspamspam'\n",
    "'spam' * 3 ='spamspamspam'\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Why is eggs a valid variable name while 100 is invalid?\n",
    "\n",
    "we can't start giving variable an integer name. if we, we should begin with, a string-like alphabet name then integer. e100 or eggs100 is valid\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "9. What three functions can be used to get the integer, floating-point number, or string version of a value?\n",
    "\n",
    "str(), int(), float()\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "10. Why does this expression cause an error? How can you fix it?\n",
